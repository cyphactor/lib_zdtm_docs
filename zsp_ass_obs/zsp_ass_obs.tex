% Description:  This document is a LaTeX document containing the
%               assumptions and observations about the synchronization
%               protocol used by Sharp's Zaurus SL-5600 v1.0 ROM and
%               Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 v3.10 ROM, in hopes to produce
%               a document that will contain enough information about
%               the protocol that it will allow people to write software
%               to interact with the Zaurus via this protocol.

\begin{abstract}
This document specifies the assumptions and observations that have been made
about the protocol created by Sharp to synchronize the Zaurus SL-5600 ROM 1.00
and up with their Windows version of Qtopia Desktop. These assumptions are
also believed to be applicable to the Zaurus SL-5500 ROM version 3.10 and up
as well as the Zaurus SL-6000 and it's Sharp ROMs.
